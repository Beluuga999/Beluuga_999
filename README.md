## The Project

Aligned works with EigenLayer to leverage ethereum consensus mechanism for ZK proof verification. Working outside the EVM, this allows for cheap verification of any proving system. This enables the usage of cutting edge algorithms, that may use new techniques to prove even faster. Even more, proving systems that reduce the proving overhead and add verifier overhead, now become economically feasable to verify thanks to Aligned.

## How to use the testnet

Download and install Aligned to send proofs in the testnet: 

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yetanotherco/aligned_layer/main/batcher/aligned/install_aligned.sh | bash
```

If you are experiencing issues, upgrade by running the same command.

### Try it!

Download an example SP1 proof file with it's ELF file using:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yetanotherco/aligned_layer/main/batcher/aligned/get_proof_test_files.sh | bash
```

Send the proof with:

```bash
aligned \
--proving_system SP1 \
--proof ~/.aligned/test_files/sp1_fibonacci.proof \
--vm_program ~/.aligned/test_files/sp1_fibonacci-elf \
--conn wss://batcher.alignedlayer.com
```

### Run

#### SP1 proof

The SP1 proof needs the proof file and the vm program file.

```bash
aligned \
--proving_system <SP1|GnarkPlonkBn254|GnarkPlonkBls12_381|Groth16Bn254> \
--proof <proof_file> \
--vm_program <vm_program_file> \
--conn wss://batcher.alignedlayer.com \
--proof_generator_addr [proof_generator_addr]
```

**Example**

```bash
aligned \
--proving_system SP1 \
--proof ./batcher/aligned/test_files/sp1/sp1_fibonacci.proof \
--vm_program ./batcher/aligned/test_files/sp1/sp1_fibonacci-elf \
--conn wss://batcher.alignedlayer.com
```

#### GnarkPlonkBn254, GnarkPlonkBls12_381 and Groth16Bn254

The GnarkPlonkBn254, GnarkPlonkBls12_381 and Groth16Bn254 proofs need the proof file, the public input file and the verification key file.

```bash
aligned \
--proving_system <SP1|GnarkPlonkBn254|GnarkPlonkBls12_381|Groth16Bn254> \
--proof <proof_file> \
--public_input <public_input_file> \
--vk <verification_key_file> \
--conn wss://batcher.alignedlayer.com \
--proof_generator_addr [proof_generator_addr]
```

**Examples**

```bash
aligned \
--proving_system GnarkPlonkBn254 \
--proof ./batcher/aligned/test_files/plonk_bn254/plonk.proof \
--public_input ./batcher/aligned/test_files/plonk_bn254/plonk_pub_input.pub \

## Register as an Aligned operator in testnet

### Requirements

> [!NOTE]
> You must be whitelisted to become an Aligned operator.

This guide assumes you are already [registered as an operator with EigenLayer](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/operator-guides/operator-installation).

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

Also, you have to install the following dependencies for Linux:

- pkg-config
- libssl-dev

To install foundry, run:

```bash
make install_foundry
foundryup
```

#### Install the Operator Binary

To install the operator binary, run:

```bash
make build_operator
```

#### Update the operator

To update the operator, first stop the process running the operator (if there is any) and then run:

```bash
git pull
make build_operator
```

#### Configuration

Update the following placeholders in `./config-files/config-operator.yaml`:

- `"<ecdsa_key_store_location_path>"`
- `"<bls_key_store_location_path>"`
- `"<operator_address>"`
- `"<earnings_receiver_address>"`

`"<ecdsa_key_store_location_path>"` and `"<bls_key_store_location_path>"` are the paths to your keys generated with the EigenLayer CLI, `"<operator_address>"` and `"<earnings_receiver_address>"` can be found in the `operator.yaml` file created in the EigenLayer registration process.
The keys are stored by default in the `~/.eigenlayer/operator_keys/` directory, so for example `<ecdsa_key_store_location_path>` could be `/path/to/home/.eigenlayer/operator_keys/some_key.ecdsa.key.json` and for `<bls_key_store_location_path>` it could be `/path/to/home/.eigenlayer/operator_keys/some_key.bls.key.json`.

### Deposit Strategy Tokens

We are using [WETH](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/restake/WETH) as the strategy token.

To do so there are 2 options, either doing it through EigenLayer website and following their guide, or running the commands specified by us below:

#### Option 1:
The eigen guide can be found [here](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/liquid-restaking/restake-lsts). 
You will need to stake a minimum of a 1000 wei in WETH. We recommend to stake a maximium amount of 10 ETH.

#### Option 2:
If you have ETH and need to convert it to WETH you can use the following command, that will convert 1 Eth to WETH. Change the parameter in ```---value``` if you want to wrap a different amount:

```bash
cast send 0x94373a4919B3240D86eA41593D5eBa789FEF3848 --rpc-url https://ethereum-holesky-rpc.publicnode.com --private-key <private_key> --value 1ether
```

Here `<private_key>` is the placeholder for the ECDSA key specified in the output when generating your keys with the EigenLayer CLI.

Finally, to end the staking process, you need to deposit into the strategy, as shown in the Eigen guide, or alternatively, you can run the following command to deposit one WETH:

```bash
./operator/build/aligned-operator deposit-into-strategy --config ./config-files/config-operator.yaml --strategy-address 0x80528D6e9A2BAbFc766965E0E26d5aB08D9CFaF9 --amount 1000000000000000000
```

If you don't have Holesky Eth, these are some useful faucets:

- [Google Cloud for Web3 Holesky Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/holesky)
- [Holesky PoW Faucet](https://holesky-faucet.pk910.de/)

### Register as an operator with Aligned

To register the operator with Aligned, run:

```bash
./operator/build/aligned-operator register --config ./config-files/config-operator.yaml
```

### Start the operator

To start the Aligned operator, run:

```bash
./operator/build/aligned-operator start --config ./config-files/config-operator.yaml
```

### Unregister the operator from Aligned

To unregister the Aligned operator, run:

```bash
cast send --rpc-url https://ethereum-holesky-rpc.publicnode.com --private-key <private_key> 0x3aD77134c986193c9ef98e55e800B71e72835b62 'deregisterOperator(bytes)' 0x00
 ```

 `<private_key>` is the one specified in the output when generating your keys with the EigenLayer CLI.

## Local Devnet Setup

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [zap-pretty](https://github.com/maoueh/zap-pretty)
- [abigen](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/tools/abigen)
- [eigenlayer-cli](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-cli.git)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/)
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)

To install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) and [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) go to the provided links and follow the instructions.

Install Go dependencies ([zap-pretty](https://github.com/maoueh/zap-pretty), [abigen](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/tools/abigen), [eigenlayer-cli](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-cli.git)):

```bash
make go_deps
```

Install [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation):

```bash
make install_foundry
foundryup
```

Install necessary submodules and build all the FFIs for your OS:

```bash
make deps
```

If you want to rebuild the FFIs you can use:

```bash
make build_all_ffi
```

### Booting Devnet with Default configs

Before starting you need to setup an S3 bucket. More data storage will be tested in the future.

You need to fill the data in:

```batcher/aligned-batcher/.env```

And you can use this file as an example on how to fill it:

```batcher/aligned-batcher/.env.example```

After having the env setup, run in different terminals the following commands to boot Aligned locally:

```bash
make anvil_start_with_block_time
```

```bash
make aggregator_start
```

```bash
make operator_register_and_start
```

```bash
make batcher_start
```

If you need to start again the operator, and it's already registered, use:

```bash
make operator_start
```

If you want to start the explorer for the devnet, see how to run it using it's [documentation](#explorer) below.

### Send test proofs to batcher for testing

All these proofs are for testing purposes

Send 8 proofs each second:

```bash
make batcher_send_burst_groth16
```

Send Groth 16 proofs each 2 seconds:

```bash
make batcher_send_infinite_groth16
```

Send an individual Groth 16 proof:

```bash
make batcher_send_groth16_task
```

To send an individual test SP1 proof:

```bash
make batcher_send_sp1_task
```

### Detailed Testnet Deployment

#### Changing operator keys

Operator keys can be changed if needed.

To create a keystore, run:

```bash
cast wallet new-mnemonic
cast wallet import <keystore-name> --private-key <private-key>
```

To create an ECDSA keystore, run:

```bash
eigenlayer operator keys import --key-type ecdsa <keystore-name> <private-key>
```

To create a BLS keystore, run:

```bash
eigenlayer operator keys import --key-type bls <keystore-name> <private-key>
```

#### Aggregator

If you want to run the aggregator with the default configuration, run:

```bash
make aggregator_start
```

To start the aggregator with a custom configuration, run:

```bash
make aggregator_start CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>
```

#### Operator

Operator needs to register in both EigenLayer and Aligned. Then it can start verifying proofs.

##### Register into EigenLayer

To register an operator in EigenLayer Devnet with the default configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_register_with_eigen_layer
```

To register an operator in EigenLayer with a custom configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_register_with_eigen_layer CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>
```

##### Register into Aligned

To register an operator in Aligned with the default configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_register_with_aligned_layer
```

To register an operator in Aligned with a custom configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_register_with_aligned_layer CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>
```

##### Full Registration in Anvil with one command

To register an operator in EigenLayer and Aligned and deposit strategy tokens in EigenLayer with the default configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_full_registration
```

To register an operator in EigenLayer and Aligned and deposit strategy tokens in EigenLayer with a custom configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_full_registration CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>
```

##### Deposit Strategy Tokens in Anvil local devnet

There is an ERC20 token deployed in the Anvil chain to use as strategy token with EigenLayer.

To deposit strategy tokens in the Anvil chain with the default configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_mint_mock_tokens
make operator_deposit_into_mock_strategy
```

To deposit strategy tokens in the Anvil chain with a custom configuration, run:

```bash
make operator_mint_mock_tokens CONFIG_FILE=<path_to_config_file>

```

#### Deposit Strategy tokens in Holesky/Mainnet

EigenLayer strategies are available in [eigenlayer-strategies](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/restake).

For Holesky, we are using [WETH](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/restake/WETH) as the strategy token.

To obtain HolETH and swap it for different strategies, you can use the following [guide](https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/restaking-guides/restaking-user-guide/stage-2-testnet/obtaining-testnet-eth-and-liquid-staking-tokens-lsts).

## Deploying Aligned Contracts to Holesky or Testnet

### Eigenlayer Contracts: Anvil

If EigenLayer contracts change, the anvil state needs to be updated with:

```bash
make anvil_deploy_eigen_contracts
```

You will also need to redeploy the MockStrategy & MockERC20 contracts:

```bash
make anvil_deploy_mock_strategy
```

### Eigenlayer Contracts: Holesky/Mainnet

These contracts are not deployed by Aligned. Current EigenLayer contracts:

- [Holesky Contracts](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/testnet-holesky/script/configs/holesky/Holesky_current_deployment.config.json)
- [Mainnet Contracts](https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-contracts/blob/mainnet/script/configs/mainnet/Mainnet_current_deployment.config.json)

### Aligned Contracts: Anvil

When changing Aligned contracts, the anvil state needs to be updated with:

```bash
make anvil_deploy_aligned_contracts
```

To test the upgrade script for ServiceManager in the local devnet, run:

```bash
make anvil_upgrade_aligned_contracts
```

To test the upgrade script for RegistryCoordintator in the local devnet, run:

```bash
make anvil_upgrade_registry_coordinator
```

#### Aligned Contracts: Holesky/Mainnet

To deploy the contracts to Testnet/Mainnet, you will need to set environment variables in a `.env` file in the same directory as the deployment script (`contracts/scripts/`).

The necessary environment variables are:

| Variable Name                   | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RPC_URL`                       | The RPC URL of the network you want to deploy to.                     |
| `PRIVATE_KEY`                   | The private key of the account you want to deploy the contracts with. |
| `EXISTING_DEPLOYMENT_INFO_PATH` | The path to the file containing the deployment info about EigenLayer. |
| `DEPLOY_CONFIG_PATH`            | The path to the deployment config file.                               |
| `OUTPUT_PATH`                   | The path to the file where the deployment info will be saved.         |

You can find an example `.env` file in [.env.example.holesky](contracts/scripts/.env.example.holesky)

Then run the following command:

```bash
make deploy_aligned_contracts
```

You need to complete the `DEPLOY_CONFIG_PATH` file with the following information:

```json
{
    "chainInfo": {
      "chainId": "<chain_id>"
    },
    "permissions" : {

To upgrade the Service Manager Contract in Testnet/Mainnet, run:

```bash
make upgrade_aligned_contracts
```

To upgrade the Registry Coordinator in Testnet/Mainnet, run:

```bash
make upgrade_registry_coordinator
```

Make sure to set environment variables in a `.env` file in the same directory as the upgrade script (`contracts/scripts/`).

### Bindings

Also make sure to re-generate the Go smart contract bindings:

```bash
make bindings
```

### Deployment

To build go binaries run:

```bash
make build_binaries
```

## Metrics

### Aggregator Metrics

Aggregator metrics are exposed on the `/metrics` endpoint.

If you are using the default config, you can access the metrics on `http://localhost:9091/metrics`.

To run Prometheus and Grafana just run:

```bash
make run_metrics
```

Then you can access Grafana on `http://localhost:3000` with the default credentials `admin:admin`.

If you want to install Prometheus and Grafana manually, you can follow the instructions below.

To install Prometheus, you can follow the instructions on the [official website](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/).

To install Grafana, you can follow the instructions on the [official website](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/).

## Explorer

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
You can access to a tasks information by visiting `localhost:4000/batches/:merkle_root`.

### Run with custom env / other devnets

Create a `.env` file in the `/explorer` directory of the project. The `.env` file needs to contain the following variables:

| Variable      | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RPC_URL`     | The RPC URL of the network you want to connect to.                                              |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | The environment you want to run the application in. It can be `devnet`, `holesky` or `mainnet`. |
| `PHX_HOST`    | The host URL where the Phoenix server will be running.                                          |

```make run_explorer```

### Send example data

If you want to have some data to see on it, you can start our infinite task sender, which will constantly send new proofs to the batcher.

```sh
make batcher_send_burst_groth16
```

## Notes on project creation / devnet deployment

Eigenlayer middleware was installed as a submodule with:

```sh
mkdir contracts
cd contacts
forge init . --no-commit
forge install Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware@mainnet
```

Then to solve the issue <https://github.com/Layr-Labs/eigenlayer-middleware/issues/229>, we changed it to:

```forge install yetanotherco/eigenlayer-middleware@yac-mainnet --no-commit```

As soon as it gets fixed in mainnet we can revert it.

Base version of middleware used is ```7229f2b```.

The script to initialize the devnet can be found on  ```contracts/scripts/anvil```.

The addresses of the relevant contracts after running the anvil script is dumped on ```contracts/script/output/devnet```.

The state is backuped on ```contracts/scripts/anvil/state```.

Eigenlayer contract deployment is almost the same as the EigenLayer contract deployment on mainnet. Changes are described on the file.

## Tests

To run the go tests

```bash
make test
```

## Verify Proofs

### SP1

#### Dependencies
This guide assumes that:
- sp1 prover installed (instructions [here](https://succinctlabs.github.io/sp1/getting-started/install.html))
- sp1 project to generate the proofs (instructions [here](https://succinctlabs.github.io/sp1/generating-proofs/setup.html))
- aligned layer repository cloned:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yetanotherco/aligned_layer.git
    ```

#### How to generate a proof

> AlignedLayer only verifies SP1 in compressed version.
> You can check you are using compressed by opening script/src/main.rs
and check that the proof is generated with `client.prove_compressed` instead of `client.prove`.

First, open a terminal and navigate to the script folder in the sp1 project directory

Then, run the following command to generate a proof:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

#### How to get the proof verified by AlignedLayer

After generating the proof, you will have to find two different files:
- proof file: usually found under `script` directory, with the name `proof.json` or similar
- elf file: usually found under `program/elf/` directory

Then, you can send the proof to the AlignedLayer network by running the following command
from `batcher/aligned` folder inside the AlignedLayer repository directory:

```bash
cargo run --release -- \
--proving_system SP1 \
--proof <proof_path> \
--vm_program <vm_program_path> \
--conn wss://batcher.alignedlayer.com \
--proof_generator_addr [proof_generator_addr]
```

## FAQ

### What is the objective of Aligned?
    
Aligned’s mission is to extend Ethereum’s zero-knowledge capabilities. We are certain the zero-knowledge proofs will have a key role in the future of blockchains and computation. We don’t know what that future will look like, but we are certain it will be in Ethereum. The question we want to share is: If we are certain zero-knowledge proofs are the future of Ethereum but we are not certain which of the many possible zero-knowledge futures will win. How can we build an infrastructure for Ethereum to be compatible with any future zero-knowledge proving system?
    
### What is the throughput of Aligned?
    
Aligned runs the verifier’s code natively. The verification time depends on the proof system, program run, and public input. Generally, most verifiers can be run in the order of ms on consumer-end hardware. We can optimize the code for speed and leverage parallelization by running it natively. Taking 3 ms per proof, Aligned could verify 300 proofs per second and, using parallelization, over 10,000 proofs per second.
    
### How does the throughput of Aligned compare with Ethereum?
    
Ethereum runs on top of the EVM. Each block is limited to 30,000,000 gas. Since the most efficient proof systems take at least 250,000 gas, Ethereum can verify 120 proofs per block. Aligned runs the code natively and leverages parallelization, reaching 10,000 proofs in the same period.
    
### Is Aligned an Ethereum L2?
    
Aligned is related to Ethereum but is not an L2 since it does not produce blocks. It is a decentralized network of verifiers.
    
### Does Aligned compete with L2s?
    
No. Aligned is a decentralized network of verifiers and has proof aggregation. It does not produce blocks or generate proofs of execution. Aligned provides L2s with fast and cheap verification for the proofs they generate, reducing settlement costs and enhancing cross-chain interoperability with quick and cheap bridging.
    
### What are the costs for Aligned?
    
The costs depend on task creation, aggregated signature or proof verification, and reading the results. The cost C per proof by batching N proofs is roughly:
    
$$
  C =\frac{C_{task} + C_{verification}}{N} + C_{read}
$$
    
Batching 1024 proofs using Aligned’s fast mode can cost around 2,100 gas in Ethereum (for a gas price of 8 gwei/gas and ETH = $3000, $0.05). As a helpful comparison, a transaction in Ethereum costs 21,000 gas, so you get proof verification for 1/10th of the transaction cost!
    
### Why do you have a fast and slow mode?
    
The fast mode is designed to offer very cheap verification costs and low latency. It uses crypto-economic guarantees provided by restaking; costs can be as low as 2100 gas. The slow mode works with proof aggregation, with higher fees and latency, and achieves the complete security of Ethereum. We verify an aggregated BLS signature (around 113,000 gas) in the fast mode. We verify an aggregated proof (around 300,000 gas) in the slow mode.
    
### Why don’t you run Aligned on top of a virtual machine?
    
Running on a virtual machine adds complexity to the system and an additional abstraction layer. It can also reduce Aligned's throughput, which is needed to offer really fast and cheap verification.
    
### Why don’t you build Aligned on top of a rollup?
    
The main problem with settling on top of a rollup is that you still need confirmation in Ethereum, which adds latency to the process. Besides, most rollups are not fully decentralized, even if they were, not to the extent of Ethereum. Aligned also achieves an already low verification cost in Ethereum, so it would not be convenient to build Aligned on top of a rollup in terms of latency, costs, and decentralization.
    
An L2 needs to use the EVM to settle in Ethereum. This means that the proofs need to be efficiently verified in the EVM, and their data made available there.
    
The EVM is not designed for ZK Verification, so most verifications are expensive.
    
To solve this, for pairing-based cryptography, Ethereum has added a precompile for verifications using the curve BN254.
    
But technology changes fast. BN254 security was demonstrated to be around 100 bits instead of the expected 128. Fast Starks need efficient hashing for fields. Which is the best field? Mersenne’s? Goldilocks? Binary fields? What about the sumcheck protocol? Is Jolt the endgame? Or is GKR going to be faster?
    
The amount of progress in the field is big, and nobody can predict the endgame.
    
Even more, it would be naive to think that only one optimized prover will exist in the future. In the world of ZK, as in many others, there are trade-offs and systems that solve different problems.
    
Maybe we want faster proving and don't care about proof size. Maybe we want the fastest proof verification and smallest size and can do more work on the prover. The system may be optimized to prove Keccak really fast. Or we can skip the traditional hashes altogether and just optimize for Poseidon, Rescue, or one hash not created yet.
    
Aligned solves all of this. No matter how or what you want to prove, it can be verified efficiently here while still inheriting the security of Ethereum as other L2s.
    
### Is Aligned an aggregation layer?
    
Aligned provides proof aggregation as part of its slow mode, a feature shared with all aggregation layers. However, Aligned offers a unique fast mode designed to provide cheap and low-latency proof verification, leveraging the power of restaking. Aligned is a decentralized network designed to verify zero-knowledge proofs and uses recursive proof aggregation as one of its tools. 
    
### What proof systems do you support?
    
Aligned is designed to support any proof system. Currently supported ones are Groth 16 and Plonk (gnark), SP1, Halo 2 (IPA and KZG)
    
### How hard is it to add new proof systems?
    
Aligned is designed to make adding new proof systems easy. The only thing needed is the verifier function, which is written in a high-level language like Rust. For example, we could integrate Jolt into one of our testnets just a few hours after it was released.
    
### What are BLS signatures?
    
[Boneh-Lynn-Shacham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLS_digital_signature) is a cryptographic signature that allows a user to verify that a signer is authentic. It relies on elliptic curve pairings and is used by Ethereum due to its aggregation properties.
    
### How does Aligned work?
    
The flow for fast verification is as follows:
    
1. The user uses a provided CLI or SDK to send one proof or many to the batcher, and waits (Alternatively, the user can run a batcher or interact directly with Ethereum)
2. The batcher accumulates proofs of many users for a small number of blocks (typically 1-3).
3. The batcher creates a Merkle Tree with commitments to all the data submitted by users, uploads the proofs to the Data Service, and creates the verification task in the ServiceManager.
4. The operators, using the data in Ethereum, download the proofs from the DataService. They then verify that the Merkle root is equal to the one in Ethereum, and verify all the proofs. 
5. If the proofs are valid, they sign the root and send this to the BLS signature aggregator.
6. The signature aggregator accumulates the signed responses until reaching the quorum, then sends the aggregated signature to Ethereum.
7. Ethereum verifies the aggregated signatures and changes the state of the batch to verified.
   
### What is restaking?
    
EigenLayer introduced the concept of Restaking. It allows Ethereum’s validators to impose additional slashing conditions on their staked ETH to participate in Actively Validated Services (AVS) and earn additional rewards. This creates a marketplace where applications can rent Ethereum's trust without competing for blockspace. Aligned is an example of an AVS.
    
### How can I verify proofs in Aligned?
    
You can verify proofs in Aligned using our CLI.
    
### Can you provide an estimate of Aligned’s savings?
    
In Ethereum (does not include access cost): 
    
- Groth 16 proofs: 250,000 gas
- Plonk/KZG proofs: >300,000 gas
- STARKs: >1,000,000 gas
- Binius/Jolt: too expensive to run!
    
In Aligned, fast mode:
    
- Just one proof (any!): 120,000 gas
- Batching 1024 proofs: 120 gas + reading cost
    
It’s over 99% savings!
    
### I want to verify just one proof. Can I use Aligned for cheap and fast verification?
    
Yes!
    
### Is Aligned open-source?
    
Yes!
    
### What are the goals of Aligned?
    
Aligned is an infrastructure that offers fast and cheap verification for zero-knowledge and validity proofs. It can take any proof system and verify it cheaply and fast.
    
This means that what Aligned wants to achieve is to allow anyone to build zk applications. This can only be achieved by:
    
- Reducing operational costs when maintaining a zk application -> anyone can afford to build zk apps.
- Offering more options so developers can choose how they want to build their protocols -> everyone can choose their tools.
- Offer the latest zk that allows anyone to build zk applications by just proving rust -> anyone can code a zk application.
    
### What’s the role of Aligned in Ethereum?
    
Aligned’s role is to help advance the adoption of zero-knowledge proofs in Ethereum, increase verification throughput, and reduce on-chain verification time and costs. Aligned can easily incorporate proof systems without any further changes in Ethereum. In a more straightforward analogy, Aligned is like a GPU for Ethereum. 
    
### What is proof recursion?
    
Zero-knowledge proofs let you generate proofs that show the correct execution of programs. If a program is the verification of a proof, then we will be getting a proof that we verified the proof and the result was valid. The validity of the second proof implies the validity of the original proof. This is the idea behind proof recursion, and it can be used with two main goals:
    
1. Convert one proof type to another (for example, a STARK proof to a Plonk proof) either to reduce the proof size, have efficient recursion, or because the proof system cannot be verified where we want.
2. Proof aggregation: if we have to verify N proofs on-chain, we can generate a single proof that we verified the N proofs off-chain and just check the single proof in Ethereum.
    
Proof recursion is the primary tool of Aligned’s slow mode.
    
### What are the use cases of Aligned?
    
Among the possible use cases of Aligned, we have:
    
Soft finality for Rollups and Appchains, fast bridging, new settlement layers (use Aligned + EigenDA) for Rollups and Intent-based systems, P2P protocols based on SNARKs such as payment systems and social networks, alternative L1s interoperable with Ethereum, Verifiable Machine Learning, cheap verification and interoperability for Identity Protocols, ZK Oracles, new credential protocols such as zkTLS based systems, ZK Coprocessor, encrypted Mempools using SNARKs to show the correctness of the encryption, protocols against misinformation and fake news, and on-chain gaming.
    
### Why build Aligned on top of Ethereum?
    
Ethereum is the most decentralized and most significant source of liquidity in the crypto ecosystem. We believe it is the most ambitious and long-term project on the internet. Aligned is being built to help Ethereum achieve its highest potential, and we believe this is only possible through validity/zero-knowledge proofs.
    
### Why EigenLayer?
    
We believe Ethereum is the best settlement layer, and zero-knowledge will play a key role in helping it become the settlement layer of the internet. We want to build a verification layer that helps Ethereum achieve this goal. This layer needs to have a decentralized group of validators that will just re-execute the verification of different proofs, but how can we build such a decentralized network that will help Ethereum? Creating a new L1 doesn’t benefit Ethereum because it will add new trust assumptions to the Ethereum protocols relying on it. So, if we must have:
1. A decentralized network of verifiers
2. A similar economic security level that can be easily measured in Ethereum
3. Part of the Ethereum ecosystem
4. Flexible enough to support many current and future proving systems

### How does it compare to the Polygon aggregation layer?

Aligned is just a network of decentralized verifiers renting security from Ethereum. On the other hand, the Polygon aggregation layer, in essence, is a rollup verifying multiple proofs. That is not the case for Aligned, which just executes a rust binary from different verifiers directly in multiple Ethereum validators.

### Why do we need a ZK verification layer?

Verifiable computation allows developers to build applications that help Ethereum scale or even create applications that were not possible before, with enhanced privacy properties. We believe the future of Ethereum will be shaped by zero-knowledge proofs and help it increase its capabilities.
